## Bug: Speaker Icon Not Showing in AI Messages

**Date**: Current session
**Issue**: Speaker icon added to AI messages was not visible in the chat interface

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Problem**: Speaker icon was added to the wrong chat component
- **Details**: 
  - Added to `/src/components/primitives/chatbot.tsx` (unused component)
  - Should have been added to `/src/app/chat/page.tsx` (actual chat page)
- **Evidence**: Two separate chat implementations exist in the codebase

### Solution Implemented
1. **Import**: Added `Speaker` icon import from `lucide-react` to `/src/app/chat/page.tsx`
2. **Component**: Added `MessageAction` with Speaker icon to AI message `MessageActions`
3. **Positioning**: Placed between Copy and other actions for logical flow
4. **Styling**: Used consistent styling with existing action buttons

### Files Modified
- `/src/app/chat/page.tsx` - Added Speaker icon import and MessageAction
- `/src/components/primitives/chatbot.tsx` - Previously modified (unused component)

### Testing
- No linting errors detected
- Speaker icon should now appear under AI messages on hover
- Icon follows same visibility rules as other action buttons (opacity-0 on hover, opacity-100 on last message)

### Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - Speaker icon now correctly added to the active chat implementation
